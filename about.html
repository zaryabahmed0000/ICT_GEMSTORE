            <h3>Our Story</h3>
            <p>Founded in 2010, Gemstone Gallery began as a small family business with a passion for exceptional jewelry and gemstones. What started as a modest boutique has grown into a premier destination for fine jewelry lovers around the world.</p>
            
            <p>Our founder, Sarah Thompson, traveled the world studying gemology and working with master jewelers before establishing Gemstone Gallery with a simple mission: to create timeless pieces that celebrate life's most precious moments.</p>

            <p>We take pride in our attention to detail and commitment to excellence. Each piece undergoes rigorous quality control before it bears the Gemstone Gallery name.</p>
